# Analog-Programmed-Machine-LTspice-LLM
The APM-1 library is a set of LTspice subcircuits replicating classical analog computer functions. It includes integrators, summers, multipliers, filters, detectors, and timing blocks, all defined for machine voltage VL=10 V. Each block uses an explicit GDN=0 pin, ensuring scalable modeling and consistency.
